## ◈ THE VISION
**Dev-Wrapped 2025** is an elite Year-in-Review engine that transforms raw GitHub telemetry into a cinematic narrative. By combining **Google Gemini (Flash or Lite)** with your real-world commit history, we reveal the hidden developer archetype behind your contributions.

---

## ◒ AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOLS

The system operates on two distinct authorization layers:

### 1. The Session Key (BYOK)
For maximum privacy and scalability, users can authorize a volatile session using their own Google Cloud Project. 
- **Free Tier Supported**: You can use a standard free Gemini API key by choosing the "Flash Lite" model or using the standard "Flash 3" model within its free-tier limits.
- **Requirement**: A Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled.
- **Security**: Keys are never stored; they exist only in memory during the analysis trace.

### 2. The Global Key (Developer Deployment)
If you are hosting this for a specific team or audience and wish to provide the AI credits:
- Set `API_KEY` in your hosting environment (e.g., Netlify/Vercel Environment Variables).
- The system will detect this key and bypass the "Authorize Session" screen for all users.
